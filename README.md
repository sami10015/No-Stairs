# No-Stairs

No Stairs is a game about getting to the top of a hotel to find your younger brother in a zombie infested hotel. The core and theme of this game is that is a Survival RPG.  As you kill zombies, you gain experience points which cause you to eventually level up.  

When you level up, you must assign these points to stats for your character.  These stats can be detrimental to your success of the game.  The stats need to be placed correctly based on your class to increase the power of your skills.  For example, if you are a shooter, you should place stat points in Vitality for health increase, and Precision for more damage.  

You need to carefully choose what stat you need to get you through the game, or else you will die.  When you die, you lower yourself a few levels on the hotel, setting you back from finding your younger brother.  

The life of your younger brother relies on you.
